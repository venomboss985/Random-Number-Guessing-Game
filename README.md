# Random-Number-Guessing-Game

# What is it?
This is a little game I put together in Lua 5.4

# How do you play?
Once you run the script, you have 5 options to choose from:
  1. Limited Guessing Game
  2. Least Guessing Game
  3. Custom Rules Game
  4. Settings (Doesn't work as of v1.0)
  5. Quit

Choose your preferred game by typing and entering the respective numbered choice in the console window.

# Limited Guessing Game
In this gamemode, you have 10 chances to guess a random number between 1-100. If you get the number wrong, don't worry, the game will tell you if the number is higher or lower than its predetermined number. If you don't get the number within 10 guesses, game over, you have to restart and try again. And it won't be the same number as last time. If you do get the number, great job! Try the next gamemode Least Guessing Game.

# Least Guessing Game
In this gamemode, you have unlimited chances to guess a random number between 1-100. The challenge here is to use the least amount of chances to guess the number correctly. If this was too easy or too hard, you can create your own rules in the next and final gamemode, Custom Rules Game.

# Custom Rules Game
In this gamemode, you create your own game. You can make your own Limited or Least Guessing Game rules by customizing the range of the random number generator. If you select the Limited Guessing Game, you can also customize how many chances you get to guess the number, so you can make it as easy or as hard as you choose!

# Future Updates
In the future, I plan on adding the following:
  - Settings menu
  - User created custom presets (without having to go through the custom game menu each time)
  - Different difficulty levels in the base game
  - Stat tracker and scoreboard
  - Console app .exe
  - Possibly more...

# Known Bugs
  - If you choose the Settings menu, it will crash
